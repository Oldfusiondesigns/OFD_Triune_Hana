FAQ

Where can I get the collapsible stock bars?
I’ll include a drawing on my github so you can make your own, or order them. However some licensed builders may make their own!
What foregrip should I use? I keep hitting my hand on the magwell!
I like the unicorn style foregrip, or you can go with the alphatrooper style, most VFGs will work if you don’t wrap your thumb around the back, it’s generally not necessary at these priming levels!
Why is there no specific spring for the trigger/mag release/stock button?
All sorts of springs can work for these applications, I’ve used retaliator catch springs, Lynx mag release springs, and more!
I have more questions, or my questions aren’t listed here!
No worries! If you have any questions, please contact me via discord (ag04#6231)
